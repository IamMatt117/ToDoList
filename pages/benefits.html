                <h2>Clarity and Focus</h2>
                <p>A to-do list turns vague intentions into clear, actionable steps. 
                    By writing tasks down, you reduce mental clutter and always know what to do next. 
                    This helps prevent procrastination and keeps you focused on the highest-impact actions rather than whatever feels urgent in the moment.

                <h2>Better Planning and Prioritization</h2>
                <p>Lists make it easy to sort tasks by priority, effort, or deadline. You can group related tasks, break big goals into smaller milestones, and plan your time realistically. 
                    This structure is especially helpful for complex goals like planning a PC upgrade, where parts, budgets, and compatibility all need to align.

                <div class="benefit-icon">📈</div>
                <h2>Visible Progress and Motivation</h2>
                <p>Checking items off a list feels good—and that’s not just emotional; it’s motivating. 
                    Seeing progress builds momentum and keeps you engaged. 
                    Over time, your completed list becomes a record of effort that reassures you you’re moving forward, even if the goal is still in progress.

                <h2>Reduced Stress and Decision Fatigue</h2>
                <p>When tasks live in your head, they compete for attention. 
                    A to-do list externalizes those tasks so your brain doesn’t have to juggle them. 
                    This reduces stress and helps you avoid the constant micro-decisions about what to do next, because the next step is already written down.

                <h2>Consistency and Habit Building</h2>
                <p>To-do lists support routines: daily planning, weekly reviews, or project check-ins. 
                    Repeating these cycles builds reliable habits. That consistency makes long-term goals, like saving for a GPU or sourcing compatible components far more achievable.

                <h2>Accountability and Collaboration</h2>
                <p>Lists make responsibilities visible. Whether you’re sharing a build plan with a friend or just keeping yourself accountable, a clear list helps align expectations and track who’s doing what. 
                    Saved lists are especially useful for revisiting plans and updating them over time.

                <div class="benefit-icon">💰</div>
                <h2>Budgeting and Resource Management</h2>
                <p>When tasks are laid out, it’s easier to attach costs, timelines, or dependencies. 
                    For example, you can plan when to buy parts, compare models, or check PSU requirements before committing. 
                    This reduces expensive surprises and helps you make informed decisions.

                <h2>Flexibility Without Chaos</h2>
                <p>Priorities change, good lists adapt. You can reorder tasks, add notes, or defer items without losing the big picture. 
                    A simple, editable list gives you structure when you need it and freedom when plans evolve.
